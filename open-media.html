      <p>Electronic media present tremendous opportunities for
        improving the nature of society. I will first talk about how
        discourse affects society, and how changes in media may
        improve societal discourse. Then I will describe the
        Xanadu[<a href="#f1">l</a>] system, and how it was built to
        achieve these goals. </p>
      <h3>16.1 Improving society</h3>
      <p><a name="fig16.1"><img src="images/fig16.1-pencil-brick.png"
      width="721" height="281"></a>
      <p>Improving society is a difficult task. More generally,
        improving complex systems is a difficult task. If you cannot
        figure out which way is up, see if you can figure out which
        way is down. Doug Engelbart, back in the early 1960s, wanted
        to explain to people why interactive systems would make a
        significant difference to their lives, and to their ability to
        express ideas. In <a href="#fig16.1">Figure 16.1</a>, the
        origin on the axis is what people were doing at the
        time--writing with pencil and paper. When he found himself
        unable to communicate to people how much better things could
        be, he contrasted their current experiences with how
        much <i>worse </i>things could be.  He tied a pencil to a
        brick, handed it to people and said, "Okay, now write." People
        found it very difficult. The unwieldy nature of the tool
        interfered with their ability to express ideas. With the
        pencil and brick for contrast, he effectively asked two
        questions: "What made the difference?"  and, "How can we move
        further in the other direction?"[<a href="#f2">2</a>] This
        experiment showed people how important their tools and their
        media were to their effectiveness, and helped them start to
        see the next brick to remove.
      <p>Karl Marx performed a similar experiment on society over the
        course of most of this century. The origin
        on <a href="#fig16.2">Figure 16.2</a> represents where we are
        now. Karl Marx tied a very large brick to a very large pencil
        and the last few years have revealed the result to be far
        worse than the even his harshest critics
        imagined.[<a href="#f3">3</a>] What made the difference
        between the societies? Two important elements were open
        markets and open media. How can we move farther in the other
        direction? In this presentation, I will be addressing the
        nature of open media, how they differ from closed media, and
        how social hypertext systems can enhance the advantages of
        those media. Applying information technologies to the further
        opening of markets is left as a mission for the reader.

      <h3>16.2 Media matter</h3>
      <p>Media matter, because it is in media that the knowledge of
        society evolves.  The health of the process by which that
        knowledge evolves is critical to the way society changes. Karl
        Popper, the epistemologist, had the insight that knowledge
        evolves by a process of variation, replication, and selection,
        much as biology does. "Variation of knowledge" is what we call
        "conjecture"--hypothesis formation, tossing new ideas out
        there.  "Replication of knowledge" is the spread of ideas
        through publication and conversation. "Selection of knowledge"
        is the discrediting of conjectures through the process of
        criticism.[<a href="#f4">4</a>] The ability of our knowledge
        to progress over time depends on an ongoing process of
        criticism, and criticism of criticism. The ideas that survive
        the critical process tend, in general, to be better than those
        that do not.
      <p>In closed societies, when arguments cannot be spoken, hard
        truths cannot be figured out. When people cannot openly
        criticize, cannot openly defend against criticism, or cannot
        openly propose ideas that conflict with the official truths,
        then they are left with mistrust and cynicism as their only
        defense. This leads to the simple heuristic of assuming the
        official truth is always wrong. For example,
        because <i>science </i>was promoted by the Soviet propaganda
        machine, pseudo-science is on the rise in Russia.  Because
        anti-Nazism was promoted by the East German propaganda
        machine, Neo-Nazism is on the rise in East Germany. The
        official truth is neither always right nor always
        wrong. Society needs a more sophisticated process for judging
        claims.
      <p>Our society does have open media. Are we in the best of all
        possible worlds? Are our media good enough? Can they be made
        significantly better?  Among our media, TV is so bad that it
        is a joke. Only slogan-sized ideas can be expressed. We prize
        the quality of discourse in our books and journals, but
        critical discussions in them are only loosely
        connected. Starting from the expression of an idea, it is hard
        to find articles that criticize that idea. When arguments
        cannot be found and navigated, the next harder
        truths <i>still </i>cannot be figured out.
      <h3>16.3 Xanadu</h3>
      <p>I rejoined Xanadu in 1988 largely because of fear about the
        dangers of nanotechnology, coupled with incredible excitement
        about the promises of nanotechnology. In looking at the
        dangers, I saw that none of us individually is clever enough
        to figure out how to solve those problems. The only hope that
        I saw in 1988--1 no longer believe it is the only hope--is
        that by creating better media for the process of societal
        discourse and societal decision-making, we stand a much better
        chance of surviving the dangers posed by new technologies, so
        that we may live to enjoy their benefits.
      <p>I am about to go through the elements of the hypertext system
        we built.  Xanadu has frequently been called Golden Vaporware,
        and many people have wondered whether this is a never-ending
        project. One of the things I want to emphasize when I go
        through all of these features is that I am only referring to
        the features that are now running in the software. We planned
        on and anticipate other features, some of which will be
        mentioned in the
        <i>future plans </i>discussion, but the body of this
        presentation will only cover what is implemented and running.
      <p>First, I will discuss the four fundamental features--links,
        transclusion, versioning, and detectors. Marc Stiegler will
        then present an example using them. Then, I will describe the
        remaining four features--permissions, reputation-based
        filtering, multimedia, and external transclusion, followed by
        some concluding remarks.
      <h3>16.4 Links</h3>
      <p>Hypertext links are directly inspired by literary
        practice. Literature has many different kinds of links
        connecting documents into a vast web.  Textual examples of
        these links include bibliographical references, marginal
        notes, quotation, footnotes, and Post-it notes.
      <p>We propose to build engines of citation, so that people can
        navigate this vast web of literature at the click of a
        mouse. Most computer text systems are predicated on a
        misconception that the meaning of a document is represented
        purely or primarily by its content. Documents are not islands.
        Conventional computer text systems put their effort into the
        appearance of individual documents. My experience in reading
        documents (especially reading a literature with which I am not
        familiar) is that it is difficult to understand documents
        without their context. A context helps answer questions such
        as, "What were the ongoing controversies that the author had
        in mind?" "What views was he supporting or attacking?"  "What
        attacks was he guarding against?" We must understand this
        whole web of connections in order to understand the documents
        we are reading.  The Xanadu system is built to provide as much
        support for this contextual information as for content.
      <p>With the ability to follow the links in this vast web of
        documents, is it not easy to get lost? How does one stay
        oriented? One answer to these questions is <i>guides, </i>a
        new kind of document that provides an orienting view together
        with links into the existing literature. I expect guides to
        come largely from people making their own organizing views of
        a literature and then cleaning them up for publication, so
        others may benefit from their work.
      <h3>16.5 Hyperlinks</h3>
      <p>Because "nanotechnology" is now used by many to mean any
        technology approaching the nanometer scale, we have been
        forced to retreat to the term "molecular nanotechnology."
        Hypertext terminology has gone through a drift similar to
        nanotech terminology. The Xanadu project is the one that
        coined the term "hypertext" and originated the notion of the
        hypertext "link." However, because the term <i>link
        </i>has come to be viewed as something much less capable than
        what we meant by it, we are now calling it
        the <i>hyperlink</i>. The distinction between the link and the
        hyperlink is crucial for supporting active criticism in open
        media.
      <p><a name="fig16.3"><img src="images/fig16.3-hyperlinks.png"
      width="742" height="476"></a>
      <p>Hyperlinks are fine-grained, bidirectional, and
        extrinsic. Frequently, an argument is not with a document or
        chapter as a whole. It is with a particular point that someone
        made at a particular place in the text.  For example, someone
        refers to the fourth law of thermodynamics, and someone else
        writes a criticism saying there is no fourth law of
        thermodynamics, linking it to the original
        (see <a href="#fig16.2">Figure 16.3</a>). The fine-grained
        property allows the link to designate the particular piece of
        text with which one is taking issue. Bidirectionality enables
        readers of the original document to find the criticism,
        enabling them to exercise fine-grained skepticism, and to
        constantly ask themselves, "What is the best argument against
        the thing I am reading <i>right now?" </i>and then, "What is
        the best argument against that, in turn?" Links provided by
        other hypertext systems generally have been only in the
        forward direction, enabling a reader to find those
        documents <i>referenced by </i>a given document.  However, to
        find criticism, the reader must find the documents
        that <i>refer to </i>the document they are reading.
      <p>Extrinsic linking is the ability to link into a document
        without editing it. Several other systems support the creation
        of links that are fine-grained at the targeted end, but these
        others do so only by modifying both source
        and <i>target </i>documents.[<a href="#f5">5</a>] Critics
        normally will not have the ability to modify the documents
        they are criticizing. They could spin off their own version
        into which they attach these links, but then other
        readers <i>still </i>cannot find these criticisms from the
        original documents.
      <p>Part of what we mean by "open media" is that everyone who is
        connected to the system can read what they are permitted to
        read, can write new things, and can make them accessible for
        others to read. This includes making links to anything that
        they have read, so that anyone else who reads the original can
        find the material that has been linked to it. All readers of
        the system are potential authors. We can think of this process
        as <i>active reading. </i>Frequently, people make marginal
        notes to themselves. This is a medium in which readers can
        share such things with each other. When much writing is
        commentary about other text, the commented-on text is the best
        rendezvous point for the authors and readers of commentary to
        find each other.
      <h3>16.6 Emergent properties</h3>
      <p>This kind of accessible criticism can provide for
        decentralized consumer reports. When people post on the system
        documents that are either products or descriptions of
        products, customers of those products can post criticisms of
        them. What did they think of using them? This commentary can
        guide the purchasing decisions of others.[<a href="#f6">6</a>]
      <p>A particular capability we are used to in conversation (one
        that is almost impossible to successfully attain using
        paper-based literature) is hearing the absence of a good
        response to an argument. A reader not only can see what the
        most compelling arguments are against some statement, but also
        see when there are none, or when all the seemingly compelling
        arguments have been successfully refuted. Such absences are
        quite obvious in conversation.  Electronic media can make
        these absences obvious as well, but in a context where the
        absence will be much more telling, because the missing
        argument could have come from a much larger audience over a
        more extended period of time.
      <p>Other hypertext systems with their unidirectional links
        reproduce the asymmetry present in our paper-based media--it
        is much easier to find something that a document cites, than
        it is to find those documents that cite a given document. One
        of the effects of this asymmetry in paper media is the
        pathological division of scholarly fields into disjoint
        "schools."  Instead of healthy intellectual engagement,
        debate, and cross-fertilization of ideas, we see a process of
        increasing inability to communicate between schools, and more
        preaching to the converted within a school. The terrible irony
        of attempting scholarship with unidirectional links is
        that <i>the very attempt to engage in healthy debate across
        schools accelerates the pathological division process. </i>How
        does this occur?
      <p>Let us consider two schools within a discipline. Generally,
        students within a school see the documents supporting the
        positions of that school.  The students also see criticisms of
        documents in the other school. Intellectually eager and honest
        students, seeking to know both sides, occasionally will follow
        these criticism links forward. The result is that they will
        see the parts of the other school's literature that is <i>most
        soundly criticized
        </i>by their own school, immunizing them more and more against
        the foreign ideas. With bidirectional links, these students
        can also find the greatest challenges to their own
        school. Bidirectional links also enable them to find
        the <i>most telling criticisms </i>of the ideas they are
        inclined to accept.
      <h3>16.7 Transclusion</h3>
      <p>Before there were modem economies, there were many little
        villages, each with their own little manufacturers having to
        go through a large amount of the production process
        themselves. These economies were, therefore, much less
        productive. An individual baker or shoemaker, for example,
        would reproduce the same kind of work that was being
        reproduced in many other villages, and would have to fashion a
        shoe, not quite from raw materials, but without intermediate
        goods. In extended economies, people can build on one
        another's work, and there can be a finer-grained division of
        labor and knowledge, with better specialization.
      <p><a name="fig16.4"><img src="images/fig16.4-transclusion.png"
      width="716" height="562"></a>
      <p>Now, with respect to literature, authors are frequently faced
        with the task of re-explaining and restating background
        material that has been explained well elsewhere. If you could
        just borrow that material, those existing good explanations,
        and incorporate them (with automatic credit where due), your
        efforts could be spent stating what is new. We introduce the
        concept of <i>transclusion </i>to separate the arrangement of
        a document from its content. There is an underlying shared
        pool of contents, and all documents are just arrangements of
        pieces from that pool. In <a href="#fig16.4">Figure 16.4</a>,
        the three circled appearances of the same text are actually
        just one piece of text in the underlying shared pool of
        contents, and it just happens to appear in three different
        arrangements which constitute three different documents. We
        refer to the three documents as <i>transcluding
        </i>that piece of text. The separation of content and
        arrangement also leads to good support for incremental
        editing. Different versions of a document are just different
        arrangements of mostly shared content.
      <p>This is more than just a hack to avoid the storage cost of
        making separate copies. Hyperlinks are linked to the content,
        not to a span in an arrangement.  Therefore, when someone
        writes a criticism of content as it appears in one
        arrangement, that criticism is visible for the same content as
        it appears in all other arrangements, including arrangements
        that were made before the criticism was attached. The normal
        incremental editing process of a single document is analogous
        to <i>evolution by point mutation. </i>The ability to
        transclude text from other documents allows the analog of
        sexual recombination. Were links visible only from the
        arrangement into which they were made, both variation
        processes would destroy selection pressures by leaving
        criticisms behind.
      <h3>16.8 Remembering the past: historical trails</h3>
      <p>As you are editing, an <i>historical trail </i>gets left
        behind--bread crumbs in history space. The historical trail is
        simply a sequential arrangement of the successive arrangements
        of contents. This is yet another kind of context important for
        understanding. "Things are the way they are because they got
        that way."[<a href="#f7">7</a>]
      <p>Understanding <i>how </i>they got that way often aids our
        understanding of what <i>they are. </i>
      <h3>16.9 Preparing for the future: detectors</h3>
      <p>In addition to looking into the past, one also reads a
        literature knowing it will be changing. How can one keep up?
        To keep track of what is happening, to keep up with changes,
        we introduce <i>detectors. </i>One can post a
        <i>revision detector </i>to find out when things are edited,
        when new versions of something appear, and then one can
        use <i>version compare
        </i>to find out how they are different. With version compare,
        one can engage in <i>differential
        reading--</i>reading<i> </i>just the differences between the
        current version and the version most recently read.
      <p><i>Link detectors </i>are a way of finding out when new links
        are made to existing material. Let us say that you published
        something, and you want to find out when others post comments
        on it. You would like to be informed of comments, but you do
        not want to have to go back and constantly recheck all the
        things that you have written, so you post a link detector on
        all the things that you have written, as well as on other
        documents on which you are interested in seeing further
        comments. You want to see what people will say about them. As
        new comments are posted on those documents, you are
        continually informed.
      <p>E-mail is just the special case where you establish a
        canonical point in the literature, for each person--a place
        others link to in order to send that person a message. That
        person simply has a link detector there saying, "Show me all
        new things that are attached to <i>here."
        </i>This generalizes to treating any shared point of interest
        in the literature, as in some sense, a "mailbox," or a
        "meeting room" for further conversation or conferencing about
        a topic. Canonical documents become meeting places. Should two
        disjoint discussions about the same topic spontaneously form
        in two places, anyone who notices can just make a link between
        them. The link detectors of each community will then inform
        them of the existence of the other.
      <p>At this point, 1 will shift over to Mark Stiegler and Dean
        Tribble, who will demonstrate, using the Xanadu software, an
        example involving exactly the elements discussed so far.
      <h3>16.10 The WidgetPerfect saga</h3>
      <p>This is a true story about how a hypertext system was able to
        save several thousand jobs, One special characteristic about
        this true story is that it is a true story from the year
        1997. It is a story about one of the events that took place at
        the company--most of you have heard of it--called
        WidgetPerfect. WidgetPerfect is the second largest
        manufacturer of widgets in the world, second only to their big
        competitor, Microwidget. The people at WidgetPerfect in the
        year 1997 had identified a really significant opportunity in
        the upcoming expanding environment of widget components
        technology.
      <p>They were developing the world's first fully modular
        widget. They had a team working on it. Dan was in charge of
        the preparation of the marketing materials for the modular
        widget. Ruth was in charge of the technical work team, and
        John was in charge of the budget and finance, as well as all
        the costing. At this point, the modular widget was in
        prototype stage when a very unfortunate thing
        happened. Microwidget, the big competitor, came out with a
        partially modular widget, hitting the marketplace first with
        an inferior product. It was technically inferior, but
        nonetheless it was in the marketplace first.
      <p>Dan was examining this Microwidget, partially modular widget,
        and it was overall inferior. Nonetheless, it had one really
        striking improved feature. It had a funculator made out of
        titanalum, whereas the fully modular widget that was being
        developed by Ruth only had a duralum funculator.  This was an
        important improvement for certain key market sectors. Even
        though the partially modular widget did not have anything
        comparable to a thermoplastic coupler or a hypervelocity
        rotator, they had to make a change.
      <p><a name="fig16.5"><img src="images/fig16.5-widgetperfect.png"
      width="737" height="1013"></a>
      <p>So, Dan created a new document in the marketing requirements
        describing this titanalum funculator. He attached a link to
        the part of the technical plan that specifically referred to
        the duralum funculator in the current plan. He made that a new
        requirement (see <a href="#fig16.5">Figure 16.5</a>).
      <p>Now, Dan knew that in order to get anything to happen with
        improving the widget prototype, he would have to talk to
        Ruth. He was reaching for the telephone to call Ruth when
        Boeing, the largest purchaser of widgets in the world, called
        him about a $15 million widget order. He got distracted with
        this purchase, and he never quite got around to calling Ruth.
      <p>We have good news. Ruth, knowing that the success of her
        technical design depended on her being able to respond
        promptly to new requirements, had attached a link detector to
        her technical plan. This link detector would be constantly
        watching for new links of the link-type <i>requirement </i>to
        be attached. When Dan attached the new requirement to the
        duralum funculator, Ruth's link detector went off. Ruth was
        alerted. She followed the link detector out to the link,
        followed the link back to the new requirement, saw what the
        required change was, and modified the technical plan to
        reflect the use of a titanalum funculator.
      <p>Well, this was all very fine, except for an additional
        problem. As I think everyone here knows, titanalum is
        considerably more expensive than duralum, and so this had some
        significant effect on the manufacturing cost. Ruth knew that
        this would have an impact on the budget, and she was reaching
        for the telephone to call John when smoke started billowing
        from the laboratory where the prototype of the modular widget
        was being manufactured. She ran off to deal with the emergency
        and never quite got around to calling John.
      <p>We have good news. John, knowing the success of his budget
        was completely dependent on his responding to modifications to
        the technical plan, had attached a revision detector to the
        technical plan and this detector was constantly watching for
        updates. So, when the technical plan was indeed updated,
        John's revision detector went off. He followed the revision
        detector up to the technical plan, used the hypertextual
        version compare capabilities based on the transclusion
        relations, compared the new version of the plan to the old,
        and found that the change was deleting duralum and replacing
        it with titanalum.  He then went back into the budget and
        updated the budget documents to reflect the increased costs
        caused by the use of titanalum.
      <p>As a consequence of this, the modular widget program was
        completed on time with a fully adequate specification. It was
        a completely superior product. It blew Microwidget off the
        face of the Earth. As a consequence, thousands of jobs at
        WidgetPerfect were saved.
      <h3>16.11 Permissions</h3>
      <p><a name="fig16.6"><img src="images/fig16.6-club.png"
      width="734" height="743"></a>
      <p>A social system, to a large extent, is a system of rights and
        responsibilities.  Xanadu has an extensive permission system
        called the <i>club </i>system, intended to deal with some of
        these issues. <a href="#fig16.6">Figure 16.6</a> shows a
        document that Bob can edit. Bob has sent it as a mail message
        to various people in a blind carbon copy ("bcc")
        relationship. Alice and Chuck are both members of
        the <i>bcc </i>club of people who have permission to read this
        document. Bob, though, is the only member who can read or edit
        the <i>bcc </i>club. If this were a <i>cc </i>list, Bob would
        still be the only person who could edit it, but it would be
        self-reading. Everybody who was a member of such
        a <i>cc </i>club could see who else was a member of that same
        club.
      <p>This demonstrates a principled answer to
      permissions <i>meta-issues--</i>0ne<i>
        </i>can distinguish between who can read a document, who can
        read the list of people who can read a document, and who can
        read that list, out to any desired degree of distinction (and
        similarly for the editing dimension).  However, infinite
        regress and needless complexity are avoided by using clubs
        that are self-reading or self-editing (or both) whenever
        further distinction is currently not necessary. Should such
        distinction later become necessary, it can always be
        introduced by someone with appropriate edit permission to the
        club in question. Users only grow meta-levels on an as-needed
        basis.
      <p>Our permission system also supports the notion
      of <i>accountability.
        </i>All actions in the system are taken <i>by
        someone. </i>When you look at information in the system, you
        see some identity attached to the actions taken on the
        information. There are no official truths. There is only who
        said what, and the structure of the system reflects that.
      <h3>16.12 Reputation-based filtering</h3>
      <p>One of the potential pitfalls of an open hypertext system is
        the junk problem. The ability to find good commentary and
        criticism will be especially important when reading very
        important documents, but it is precisely on <i>these
        </i>documents that one expects to be inundated with tons of
        worthless or irrelevant links. Without a filtering mechanism,
        it would be on exactly the documents for which one most needs
        good commentary that the provision of commentary would be most
        useless. For example, imagine how many links there would be
        onto the First Amendment to the Constitution.
      <p>Links can be <i>endorsed </i>as worth reading by various
        readers. However, no one may endorse with the identity of
        another. Different endorsers will establish varying
        reputations with different readers, much as with movie
        reviewers. Readers can filter their views of links into a
        document both by <i>who </i>endorsed as well as by
        link-type. When even this mechanism gives too coarse an
        answer, one can rely on documents such as a hypothetical
        <i>Guide to the Citations to the Bill of Rights, </i>endorsed
        by a reputable publishing house. This very same link filtering
        ability is also what allows one to find such guides in the
        presence of a swamp of links.
      <h3>16.13 Hypertext + multimedia = hypermedia</h3>
      <p>Increasingly, ideas are being expressed in media other than
        text, and increasingly, computers are used to handle these
        other media. We usually refer to <i>hypertext </i>because text
        is the most important case and the clearest example. However,
        nothing I have presented, none of the things you have seen the
        system do, is in any way specific to text, or even to media
        that have linear flow to them. It all applies equally well to
        a variety of other media (such as sound, engineering drawings,
        Postscript images, and compressed video). In all cases, one
        can make fine-grained links, edits, transclusions, and version
        compares ( even if the data is block-compressed or
        block-encrypted). Although the implementation has some
        optimizations targeted at text, in no way does
        the <i>architecture
        </i>make any special cases for text. Documents can, of course,
        be composite arrangements in which several media are mixed
        together.
      <h3>16.14 External transclusion</h3>
      <p>No software system is an island. We do not imagine that once
        the product is available, everyone will instantly take all
        information to which they want access and transfer it into
        Xanadu. We have to coexist with many other systems for many
        good reasons.
      <p>We handle that with <i>external transclusion. </i>Our
        documents are able to transclude into arrangements that are
        within the system. These, in turn, are able to represent
        transclusions of materials that are stored elsewhere. By
        perceiving other systems through the window of Xanadu, you can
        see those other systems as if all those documents were within
        the Xanadu system. Through Xanadu, I could follow a link from
        a WAIS document into a Lexis document, even though neither
        system has any notion that such a link even exists. It is not
        just that the Xanadu system is not an island, that we have to
        coexist with everything else, it is that through
        Xanadu, <i>those </i>systems are able to coexist with each
        other in a way they are unable to now, making <i>them </i>into
        non-islands.
      <h3>16.15 Conclusions</h3>
      <p><a name="tab16.1"><img src="images/tab16.1-best-both.png"
      width="755" height="389"></a>
      <p>When we started building the system, we were thinking purely
        in terms of paper-based literature-of writing. What we have
        built is something that has many of the best aspects of both
        writing and conversation (see
        <a href="#tab16.1">Table 16.1</a>). Many of the aspects of
        each are complementary. Many virtues of conversation make up
        for flaws in writing and vice versa. We found ourselves
        building a system that supports the dynamic give-and-take of
        conversation, and the persistence and thoughtfulness of
        literature.
      <p>Our status is that we currently have a working, portable
        server. It has some bugs in it, including some performance
        bugs, but we are working on it. However, all the features that
        I talked about so far, work. We are continuing ahead with the
        effort on both the server and the front end.  The front end is
        in a preliminary stage. We consider it adequate to show that
        the server is real, and to exercise its features. We plan to
        do a much better front end. The protocol between the front end
        and the server is very stable, and has been stable for a long
        time now. Our plans are to get investors, and to finish both
        the front end and the server. The target for our first product
        is small- to medium-sized workgroups within companies that
        have a large body of documents they need to be managing and
        evolving.
      <p>Our first product lacks one major feature. We provide
        hypertext because documents are not islands. We make the
        system interpersonal because people are not islands. We
        provide for the transparent windowing into other systems
        because no product is an island. However, for the moment, each
        server is still an island with respect to the other servers,
        and so each workgroup is also an island. We have designed the
        system so that, soon after first product, we will be able to
        weave all the servers together into a transparent distributed
        system. When you follow a link from one document to another,
        if the other document is not here but in some server in Tokyo,
        it will be transparently fetched for you, and the only thing
        you will notice is that following that link took longer.
      <p>For any media to radically improve the process of opinion
        formation in society, we believe it <i>needs </i>features
        equivalent to fine-grained, bidirectional, extrinsic, filtered
        links. These links must not get lost when the documents to
        which they are attached change. Issues of authority, privacy,
        and responsibility must be handled in a robust and secure
        fashion.  Open entry of readers and editors is crucial for
        open discussion. Open entry of server providers is less
        obvious, but equally important, in order to make centralized
        control impossible. We will be providing support for people
        who want to do online services based on our software. All of
        this is necessary to achieve our open electronic publishing
        dream. In so doing, we hope to improve the quality of public
        debate, in order to obtain the benefits of the open society
        yet again.
